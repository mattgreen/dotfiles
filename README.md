## Introduction

A minimalist, topic-oriented zsh dotfiles setup inspired by **@holman**.

I don't have any qualms with dotfile frameworks like oh-my-zsh or prezto. I've used them with some luck in the past, and I wanted to put some time and understanding into how they worked by writing my own. As my shell needs are fairly simple, I value fast startup time over tons of aliases. I also only add aliases/scripts I use regularly.
