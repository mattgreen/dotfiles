### Intro
A minimalist, topic-oriented zsh dotfiles setup inspired by **@holman**.

I don't have any qualms with dotfile frameworks like oh-my-zsh or prezto. I've used them with some luck in the past, and I wanted to put some time and understanding into how they worked by writing my own. As my shell needs are fairly simple, I value fast startup time over tons of aliases. I also only add aliases/scripts I use regularly.

Though I took the time to write a nice README, my dotfiles aren't very configurable. Best to just steal what you want.

### What's Nifty?
* Stylish, two-line [prompt](https://github.com/mattgreen/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/prompt.zsh) with git info
* [Jump alias](https://github.com/mattgreen/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/jump.zsh) to switch between projects quickly
