### Intro
A brutally minimalist, topic-oriented dotfiles setup ala **@holman**.

I value simple, robust tools that stay out of my way. My shell needs are fairly simple, so I don't have much in the way of interesting aliases or nifty prompts. Fast startup time is key for me, I greatly dislike tools that break flow.

### What's Nifty?
* Stylish, two-line [fish prompt](https://github.com/mattgreen/dotfiles/blob/master/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish) with async git dirty checks
* [Jump alias](https://github.com/mattgreen/jump) to switch between projects quickly
* Extremely fast startup:
